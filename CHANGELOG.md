## [0.0.1] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- GitHub Actions release workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):
  - Unified matrix build job covering Linux x86_64, Linux aarch64, Linux x86_64 (Legacy), Windows x86_64, Windows i686 (Legacy)
  - Optional legacy builds via `build_legacy_linux` and `build_legacy_windows` dispatch inputs
  - Shared `resolve-version` job output to eliminate repeated version resolution
  - Release job guarded with `if: ${{ !failure() && !cancelled() }}` to handle skipped legacy jobs correctly
- `docker.dev` multi-stage Dockerfiles for all distro images to reduce final image size and remove build tool residue
- Release assets:
  - `ojo-v0.0.1-linux-x86_64`
  - `ojo-v0.0.1-linux-aarch64`
  - `ojo-v0.0.1-linux-x86_64-legacy`

### Documentation
- `README.md` updated with build and release instructions and release asset run examples
- Project behavior documented: Ojo is a lightweight OpenTelemetry host metrics agent that collects system and process metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network, filesystem, process), computes deltas/rates, and exports to OTLP endpoints with configurable polling, filtering, and batching
